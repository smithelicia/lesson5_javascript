### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Locating errors with the browser console: One of the best ways to figure out where errors are in your code is to run a live preview of your html file on your browser console, and inspect the code from there. The browser console will be able to tell you what line of code the error is in, and what the error is exactly.
2. Defining a function: When defining a function, you can name it, or leave it anonymous. If you anticipate calling the function somewhere else in the code, you need to name the function so that you can specifically call that function. However if you only plan on using the function once, it does not need a name and can remain anonymous.
3. Return statement: The purpose of the return statement is to stop the execution of the function, and return a value to the statement that is calling the function.
